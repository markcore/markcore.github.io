<h3>Generalized Learning Analytics</h3></a>

<ul>
	<li>Building reusable components
for common tasks such as data cleaning and calculation of basic metrics based on common data
such as 
the <a href="https://www.adlnet.gov/research/performance-tracking-analysis/experience-api">DoD
	xAPI standard</a>.</li> 
A key area of reseach is interpreting generalized metrics
(e.g., reaction time, correctness) based on archetypes. An archetype
is a category of learner such as "struggling novice" or "disengaged"
which may need additional support/motivation.
</ul>


<a name="branching">
<h3>INOTS and ELITE: Branching conversations to support interpersonal skills training</h3></a>

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<p>
Branching conversations consist of decision points. At each
decision point, the virtual role player acts out a set of lines and
the learner is presented with choices for how to
respond. Each of those choices is connected to another decision point
in the conversation until a conversation ending is reached.
</p>

<p>

The <a href="https://ict.usc.edu/prototypes/INOTS"> INOTS</a> project
used this framework in a classroom setting at the Navy's Officer
Training Command. Learners can practice dealing with the personal and
performance problems of virtual subordinates before taking command. In
the classroom, one learner "talks" directly to the virtual role player
while the rest of the class votes on the best option using electronic
clickers. The intelligent tutoring system presents this data to the
instructor via an "instructor control panel" (ICP). Performance of the
class and individual learners can be visualized via a variety of
charts and graphs. The ICP also allows the instructor to see the links
between the choices offered and the instructional design (i.e., why a
choice is correct, incorrect or
mixed). <a href="https://ict.usc.edu/prototypes/ELITE">ELITE</a> is a
version of the system customized for the Army.

<a href="https://ict.usc.edu/prototypes/MILES">
MILES</a> is a version of the system created for USC's Center for
Innovation and Research on Veterans and Military Families (CIR). In
this case, the virtual human plays the role of a veteran, and
learners practice their motivational interviewing skills.

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://ict.usc.edu/prototypes/elite_lite">ELITE Lite</a> and 
<a href="https://ict.usc.edu/prototypes/inots_counseling/">INOTS
Counseling</a> are versions of ELITE and INOTS respectively that
learners can run on their personal computers. An intelligent tutoring
system provides hints and feedback during the simulated conversation,
and the instructor control panel was replaced with a self-directed
performance review. <a href="https://ict.usc.edu/prototypes/mind/">MIND is a
personal-computer version of MILES</a> customized for use by the Veterans Affairs
(VA) Puget Sound, and the University of Washington, Department of
Psychology.
</p>

<p>
ELITE Lite is a general platform for training interpersonal skills. In
addition to interactive scenarios with virtual role players, the
platform can deliver videos demonstrating good and bad approaches to
addressing issues, and an instructional video with multiple choice
questions designed to teach the target
skills. <a href="https://ict.usc.edu/prototypes/stat/">STAT</a> is an
example of using this platform for a different domain. In this case,
users play the role of a school administer or psychologist conducting
threat assessment interviews with a virtual student. ELITE Lite is
also being used for Sexual Harassment/Assault Response &amp;
Prevention (SHARP) training in the context
of <a href="https://ict.usc.edu/prototypes/elite_sharp_ctt/">ELITE
SHARP CTT</a>
and <a href="https://ict.usc.edu/prototypes/elite_sharp_post/">ELITE
SHARP POST</a>.

<a name="engage">
<h3>Engage: Empiricial research into promoting learner engagement in virtual learning environments</h3></a>

<p>

We know that generally, learner emotions can have short-term impacts
(e.g., bored students seeking to speed through an exercise) as well as
long-term impacts (e.g., general dislike for a subject). The Engage
project uses the ELITE-Lite training system to explore the following
topics in support of general guidelines for promoting learner
engagement:

<ul>
<li>How learner traits impact their performance, and interact with changes to the tutoring system (e.g., increased help given).</li>
<li>Learner moment-to-moment facial expressions as they interact with the system.</li>
<li>Learner self-assessments of the learning experience after the fact.</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<p>
As a Ph.D. student at the University of Rochester, I focused on <b>dialogue parsing</b>, <b>natural language understanding</b> in the context of spoken dialogue. NOTE, I use the spelling "dialogue" here for consistency although you'll see "dialog parsing" in the papers. I extended traditional syntactic analysis to encompass overlapping speech and <b>speech repairs</b>, disruptions to spoken utterances such as self-corrections and filled pauses (e.g., um, uh). Another aspect of dialogue parsing is recognition of the intended actions (i.e., <b>dialogue acts</b>) associated with an utterance. I worked with the Discourse Resource Initiative in an effort to unify dialogue annotation schemes from different groups to facilitate collaborative efforts to build large, annotated corpora. James Allen and I wrote up the final annotation scheme, DAMSL (Dialog Act Markup in Several Layers), which has been used as a starting point for a number of dialogue annotation efforts. Although not the focus of my thesis, I also explored using dialogue act co-occurences as a tool for <b>discourse analysis</b> of the problem-solving dialogues in my test corpus.  
</p>

<p>
As a research fellow at the University of Edinburgh, I shifted my focus from dialogue systems acting as conversational assistants to dialogue systems acting as <b>intelligent tutoring systems</b>. In addition to working on natural language understanding, I annotated human tutoring dialogues to inform design of our system through discourse analysis. In particular, I investigated management of <b>initiative</b> (i.e., control of the dialogue) exploring who had initiative (student or tutor) and when.
</p>

<p>
As a research scientist at USC's Institute for Creative Technologies, one of my research areas is the use of dialogue systems as <b>virtual role players</b> allowing learners to practice interpersonal skills through <b>menu-based</b> or <b>open-response</b> interaction. The ability of such role players to explain their behavior (<b>explainable artificial intelligence</b>) is crucial to allowing the intelligent tutoring system to diagnose learner mistakes in scenarios that may include randomness and pre-scripted challenges. One challenge in developing explainable artificial intelligence is that background knowledge is often implicit in the utterances of the virtual role players. This is especially true for tutoring cultural awareness and we built a prototype <b>computational model of culture</b> to make the cultural motives of virtual role players explicit. <b>experience manipulation</b> is another area in which the tutor and virtual role player work together to promote learning. In this case, the tutor influences the responses of the virtual role player (e.g., making the scenario easier or harder; generating indirect feedback).</p>

<p>
Another focus area is immersive technologies ranging from mixed-reality experiences, VR headset-based interfaces and 3D simulations. 
 
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>lifelong learning</b> refers to technology such as artificial learning companions that is designed to support long-term learning across a variety of domains.</li>

<li><b>reflective tutors</b> are intelligent tutoring systems that support after action reviews 
	in which learners review their interaction with a virtual role player or other simulated experience.</li>
<li><b>authoring tools</b> allow teachers and subject matter experts to create intelligent 
	tutoring systems and virtual role players without requiring experience in AI or 
	programming.</li>
<li><b>immersive technologies</b> include simulated 3D worlds and hardware such as VR headsets.</li>


</ul>

Notable fielded systems
<ul>
<li><b>BiLAT</b> is a training system that allows learners to participate in menu-based bilateral negotiation role-plays set in the
	context of common Iraqi cultures (partner: U.S. Army's Games for Training program).</li>

<li><a href="standardpatient.net">Standard Patient Studio</a> is a training system that allows medical students to practice
	taking a medical history through open-response role-plays. It also includes an authoring
	tool allowing doctors to create new scenarios for their students (partner: USC Keck School of Medicine).</li>
